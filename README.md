# My Machine Learning Introduction

Basic Operations of following Essential Machine Learning Libraries 

1. Numpy 
- The NumPy library is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays
- Documentation -> https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
  
2. Pandas 
- The Pandas library is built on NumPy and provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
- Documentation -> https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

3. Matplotlib
- Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
platforms
- Documentation -> https://matplotlib.org/contents.html

4. Scikit Learn
- Scikit-learn is an open source Python library that implements a range of machine learning, preprocessing, cross-validation and visualization algorithms using a unified interface
