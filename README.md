# My Machine Learning Introduction

Basic Operations of following Essential Machine Learning Libraries 

### 1. Numpy 
- The NumPy library is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays
- Documentation -> https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
- Notebook -> [Into to Numpy](https://github.com/VishwasMore/introduction-to-MachineLearning/blob/master/intro-to-numpy.ipynb)
  
### 2. Pandas 
- The Pandas library is built on NumPy and provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
- Documentation -> https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
- Notebook -> [Into to Pandas](https://github.com/VishwasMore/introduction-to-MachineLearning/blob/master/intro-to-panda.ipynb)

### 3. Matplotlib
- Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
platforms
- Documentation -> https://matplotlib.org/contents.html
- Notebook -> [Into to Matplotlib](https://github.com/VishwasMore/introduction-to-MachineLearning/blob/master/intro-to-matplotlib.ipynb)

### 4. Scikit Learn
- Scikit-learn is an open source Python library that implements a range of machine learning, preprocessing, cross-validation and visualization algorithms using a unified interface
- Documentation -> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
- Notebook -> [Into to Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/VishwasMore/introduction-to-MachineLearning/blob/master/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)
